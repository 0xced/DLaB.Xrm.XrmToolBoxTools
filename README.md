This repository contains multiple plugins for the [XrmToolBox](https://www.XrmToolBox.com).  

## XrmToolBox Plugins
* [Early Bound Generator](https://github.com/daryllabar/DLaB.Xrm.XrmToolBoxTools/wiki/Early-Bound-Generator) - Extends and automates the creation of Early Bound Xrm classes
* [Attribute Manager](https://github.com/daryllabar/DLaB.Xrm.XrmToolBoxTools/wiki/Attribute-Manager) **BETA!!!** - Allows the addition/editing of attributes, including renaming and changing Attribute Types.  This will eventually replace the [Local to Global Option Set Converter](https://xrmoptionsetconverter.codeplex.com/).  **This is not production ready!  It is released with exactly zero warranty or support. If it deletes files or kills your family pet, you have been warned. It might work great, and it might not. It hasn't been tested against all CRM versions and entity scenarios, but it works on my machine/environment for the tasks that I have used it for.**
